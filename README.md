# Speed Read Test - Support

## About the App

Speed Read Test helps you measure and improve your reading speed using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technology, which displays text one word at a time.

## How to Use

### Speed Test Mode
1. Tap **START TEST** on the home screen
2. **Hold anywhere** on the screen to begin reading
3. Words will display one at a time, starting at 300 WPM and accelerating up to 900 WPM
4. **Release** when you can no longer keep up
5. Answer the comprehension question to verify your reading
6. View and share your results

### Practice Mode
1. Tap **"or paste your own text"** at the bottom of the home screen
2. Paste any text you want to read
3. Select your preferred speed (200-600 WPM)
4. Hold to read, release to pause
5. Use the controls to adjust speed or go back

## Tips

- Focus on the **red letter** in each word - this is the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)
- Don't try to "read" in the traditional sense - let your brain absorb the words
- Practice regularly to improve your speed

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to hold the screen?**
A: The hold-to-read interaction lets you control exactly when you're reading and makes it easy to stop when you can't keep up.

**Q: What's a good reading speed?**
A: The average person reads 200-300 WPM. Above 400 WPM is above average, and 600+ WPM is considered speed reading.

**Q: Why did I fail the comprehension check?**
A: Speed without comprehension isn't useful. Try slowing down - your true reading speed is the fastest you can go while still understanding the content.
